# 10. Real-time Gaming Leaderboard

- MySQL does not scale to millions of users.

- Do we need a message queue between the game service and the leaderboard service?

  - If the data is used in other places or supports multiple functionalities, then it might make sense.
  - This way, the same data can be consumed by multiple consumers.

- Redis solution - sorted sets

  - The time complexity of an add or find O(log(n))

- If use sharing, we have to use Scatter-gather

- To be safe, allocate twice the amount of memory for write-heavy applications

- When use NoSQL, It also be needed to use Scatter-gather

# 11. Payment System

- The payment service only processes payment that pass this risk (money laundering, financing of terrorism) check. The risk check service uses a third-party provider because it is very complicated and high specialized.
- The ledge keeps a financial record of the payment transaction.
- The wallet keeps the account balance of the merchant.
- The data type of the “amount” field is “string”, rather than “double”. Double is not good choice because:
  - Different protocols, sw, and hardware may support different numeric precisions in serialization and deserialization. This difference might cause unintended rounding errors.
  - The number could be extremely big (ex JP GDP 5 x 10^14), or extremely small (ex. satoshi of Bitcoin is 10^-8)
- It is recommended to keep numbers in string format during transmission and storage. The are only parsed to numbers when used for display or calculation.
