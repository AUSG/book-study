# 7. Hotel Reservation System

- One more thing…

  ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e43157e1-2cef-4d69-8dad-cf99d52efdc0/8e8c0980-65bc-4f85-a0cb-aa3510b4d333/Untitled.png)

- Actual write transaction usually smaller then expected

  1. View hotel/room detail (QPS = 300)
  2. Order booking page (QPS = 30)
  3. Reserve rooms (QPS = 3)

- API design

  - Hotel-related APIs
    - GET /v1/hotels/ID
    - POST /v1/hotels
      - Add a new hotel
    - PUT /v1/hotels/ID
      - Update hotel info
    - DELETE /v1/hotels/ID
  - Room-related APIs
    - GET /v1/hotels/ID/rooms
    - ….
  - Reservation related APIs
    - GET /v1/reservations
    - ….

- reservationID is used as the idempotency key to prevent double booking.

- The relationship different entities of RDB is stable

- If the reservation data is too large for a single DB?

  - Store only current and future reservation data.
  - Database sharding
    - The data can be sharded by hash(hotel_id) % number_of_servers

- For prevent double booking that the same user clicks on the book button multiple times.

  - Client-side impl
    - But users can disable JS, thereby bypassing the client check.
  - Idempotent APIs.
    - By using some key value at req, It can prevent duplicated req.
    - Also can use that key as DB unique constraint.

- The solution for race condition

  - Pessimistic locking
  - Optimistic locking
  - Database constraints

- One thing worth mentioning is that even when there is enough inventory shown in Redis, we still need to recheck the inventory at the DB side as a precaution. The DB is the source of truth (SOT) for the inventory data.

# 8. Distributed Email Service

- Email protocols
  - Sending
    - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
      - The standard protocol for sending emails from one mail server to another.
  - Retrieving
    - POP (Post Office Protocol)
      - Once emails are downloaded to your computer or phone, they are deleted from the email server, which means you can only access emails on one computer or phone.
      - It requires mail clients to download the entire mail. This can take a long time if an email contains a large attachment.
    - IMAP (The Internet Mail Access Protocol)
      - This protocol only downloads msg when you click it, and emails are not deleted from mail servers, meaning that you can access emails from multiple devices.
      - IMAP is the most widely used protocol for individual email accounts.
  - Etc
    - HTTPS
      - It is not technically a mail protocol, but it can be used to access your mailbox.
      - For example, it’s common for MS Outlook to talk to mobile devices over HTTPS, on a custom protocol called ActiveSync.
- A DNS server is used to look up the mail exchange record (MX record) for the recipient’s domain.
- MIME (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extension)
  - It is a specification that allows the attachment to be sent over the internet.
- Maildir was a popular way to store email msg on the mail server.
- Email Protocol (POP, IMAP, and SMTP) were invented a long time ago and they were not designed to support multimedia, threading, search, labels, and so on, nor were they scalable to support bilions of users.
- Real-time servers
  - This are stateful servers because they need to maintain persistent connections.
  - WebSocket =(fallback)> long-polling.
  - Apache James (JSON Meta Application Protocol) subprotocol over WebSocket
- Even though Cassandra supports blob data type and its max theoretical size for a blob is 2GB, the practical limit is less than 1MB
- Inverted index is the data structure that support very fast full-text searches.
- Exponential backoff might be a good retry strategy for sending mail outgoing queue.
- At Gmail or Outlook scale, the db is usually custom-made to reduce input/output per second (IOPS), as this can easily become a major constraint in the system.
- Google Bigtable is used by Gmail.
- One way to store the data is to use user_id as partition key so data for one user is stored on a single shard.
- Traditionally, a thread is implemented using algorithms such as JWZ algorithm.
  - Core concept is Using Email header (Message-Id, In-Reply-To, References), It can reconstruct thread.
- Email spam is a huge issue. According to research, more than 50% of all emails sent are spam.
- By Amazon Simple Email Service, it takes 2 ~ 6 weeks to warm up a new IP Address.
- The 93% of mail is phishing and pretexting
- Some of the common techniques to combat phishing
  - SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
  - DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
  - DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)
- Large-scale email providers usually develop their own custom search engines to meet their specific requirements.
- LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Tree)
  - The structure is the index data on disk.
  - It is the core data structure behind db such as Bigtable, Cassandra and RocksDB.

# 9. S3-like Object Storage

- At a high-level, storage systems fall into three broad categories

  - Block storage

    - This came first in the 1960s
    - HDD, SSD is a kind of physical block storage.
    - Some applications like a DB, or VM manage these blocks directly in order to squeeze every drop of performance.
    - Block storage could be connected to a server over high-speed network or ever industry-standard connectivity protocols like FC (Fibre Channel) and iSCSI. To the servers, it works the same as physically attached block storage

  - File storage

    - It is built on top of block storage.
    - It is the most common general-purpose storage solution.
    - file-level network protocols like SMB/CIFS and NFS.
    - The servers accessing file storage do not need to deal with the complexity of managing the blocks, formatting volume, etc.

  - Object storage

    - Object storage is new.
    - Sacrifice performance for high durability, vast scale, and low cost.
    - It targets relatively “cold” data and is mainly used for archival and backup
      - T 우리는 S3를 어떻게 사용해오고 있던 것인가…?
    - Object storage stores all data as objects in a flat structure. There is no hierarchical directory structure.

  - The objects stored inside of object storage are immutable. We cannot make incremental changes.

  - By research at LinkedIn, 95% of request are read operations.

  - The placement service is critical service, so we suggest building a cluster of 5 or 7 placement service nodes with Paxos or Raft consensus protocol.

    - For example, if the placement service cluster has 7 nodes, it can tolerate a 3 node failure.

  - Trade-off between consistency and latency

  - Durability

    - Multi-datacenter replication

    - Erasure coding

  - For pagination sharded DB, we can use denormalize table for pagination.

  - For optimizing uploads of large files, we can use Multipart upload.

  - By running data compaction, garbage data that is result after multipart upload could be cleaned.
