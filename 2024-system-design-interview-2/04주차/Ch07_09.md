- One more thing…

- Actual write transaction usually smaller then expected

  1. View hotel/room detail (QPS = 300)
  2. Order booking page (QPS = 30)
  3. Reserve rooms (QPS = 3)

- API design

  - Hotel-related APIs
    - GET /v1/hotels/ID
    - POST /v1/hotels
      - Add a new hotel
    - PUT /v1/hotels/ID
      - Update hotel info
    - DELETE /v1/hotels/ID
  - Room-related APIs
    - GET /v1/hotels/ID/rooms
    - ….
  - Reservation related APIs
    - GET /v1/reservations
    - ….

- reservationID is used as the idempotency key to prevent double booking.

- The relationship different entities of RDB is stable

- If the reservation data is too large for a single DB?

  - Store only current and future reservation data.
  - Database sharding
    - The data can be sharded by hash(hotel_id) % number_of_servers

- For prevent double booking that the same user clicks on the book button multiple times.

  - Client-side impl
    - But users can disable JS, thereby bypassing the client check.
  - Idempotent APIs.
    - By using some key value at req, It can prevent duplicated req.
    - Also can use that key as DB unique constraint.

- The solution for race condition

  - Pessimistic locking
  - Optimistic locking
  - Database constraints

- One thing worth mentioning is that even when there is enough inventory shown in Redis, we still need to recheck the inventory at the DB side as a precaution. The DB is the source of truth (SOT) for the inventory data.
